# Task 2: generate the UI for the report
- This report has the ability to group categories and provide total sum
- Net Income is calculated and on the bottom
- Gross Profit not provided yet on this report, need extra time to figure out how to customize this on the report
- be able to show the expanded dropdown UX above

# Task 3: user clicks on a particular cell display the transactions that contributed 
- For now, only enabled Expense cells able to clickable, this is extra code added to demo how to make cell clicable
- when hover Expense cells, background color updated
- when click Expense cells, a slide panel showing with animation
- when slide panel shows, it fetched transactions details data and displayed on the panel
- slide panel can be closed by click Close button


# Task 4: Darp and Drop to re-categorize transactions
- the transactions on the panel now able to drag and drop
- when it drop to the same category, it won't chagne anything
- when it drop to different category, it will simulate sending request to `updateTransaction`
- typically, we would update the report by calling the `getReport` after update succeed, so, no aggrecation calculation needed on front end
